## Intoduction 
An Oktopod team is a group of individuals who collaborate with a US-based client, and now they have the option to join a startup incubation program as well. This program is designed to assist Oktopod team members in developing and launching their own technology-related products or services. The team receives support, mentorship, and technical resources to enhance their skills, create a viable product, and prepare for launch.

The team has two alternatives to choose from: they can work exclusively for a US-based client or work for the same client while simultaneously developing their own startup. If they choose the latter, they are accountable for creating a project that they can sell and must be motivated to design apps, software, or other technology-related products or services. The team members must be adaptable and willing to learn new skill sets to achieve their objectives.

# Get started 

## Intoduction 
An Oktopod team is a group of individuals who collaborate with a US-based client, and now they have the option to join a startup incubation program as well. This program is designed to assist Oktopod team members in developing and launching their own technology-related products or services. The team receives support, mentorship, and technical resources to enhance their skills, create a viable product, and prepare for launch.

The team has two alternatives to choose from: they can work exclusively for a US-based client or work for the same client while simultaneously developing their own startup. If they choose the latter, they are accountable for creating a project that they can sell and must be motivated to design apps, software, or other technology-related products or services. The team members must be adaptable and willing to learn new skill sets to achieve their objectives.

## Training in Timmsi: 
Timmsi is a tool used by Oktopod to help users manage their projects and collaborate with team members. Training in Timmsi will help users become proficient in using the tool and take full advantage of its features.

## Attaching to a client: 
Oktopod can help users find clients to work with by matching them with businesses that need their services. By attaching to a client, users can gain experience and build their reputation while working on real-world projects.

## Working for a client: 
Once attached to a client, users can start working on projects and delivering results. This can help them build their skills and earn income while gaining valuable experience.

## Working for a client and working on your start-up: 
For users who have a start-up idea, they can work on their own business while also working for a client. This allows them to generate income and build their start-up simultaneously.

## Detaching from the client: 
As users' start-ups grow and become more established, they may choose to detach from their clients and focus solely on their business. This can allow them to scale their business and pursue their goals more fully.

## 50%-50% equity ratio: 
For users who work on their start-up while also working for a client, Oktopod may offer a 50%-50% equity ratio. This means that users can retain ownership and control of their start-up while also earning income from their work with Oktopod.
